Working on this project made me realize a few things:
1 - I have so much more practicing to do
2 - I have so much more to learn
3 - I LOVE CODING.

Nothing feels better than being stuck on a problem and then solving it. It happened a few times during this project and it just made me feel so good
when I finally solved it. For example, on the bottom container with the blue section with a width of 50%, the width was causing an issue where the left and right margin of the container were a different color to the background color I was using on all the other parts of the website. Then, after some quick googling, someone mentioned the color of the body. Well, I was so stuck on trying to make the left/right margin a different color (which is not possible by the way) that when I saw the word body, a lightublb clicked. Duh... just scroll up and change the body background color to the specific color I wanted.

There's still a lot more I have to work on but this project was good practice. Flexbox, fonts, typography, etc. I still need to go back and work on responsiveness, which I will probably do soon. I'm curious as to how other TOP student's created their websites.
